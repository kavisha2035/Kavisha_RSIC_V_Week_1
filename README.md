Welcome to the **RTL Design Workshop**, a practical learning series designed to introduce you to **Register Transfer Level (RTL) design**, **simulation**, **logic synthesis**, and **digital circuit optimization**.  
This repository is structured into multiple days, each focusing on specific topics with hands-on labs, examples, and detailed notes.

## üîé Overview
This workshop is created for **students, electronics enthusiasts, and engineers** who are eager to build strong fundamentals in **digital hardware design**.  

By the end of this workshop, you will gain practical knowledge of:
- Writing Verilog code for RTL-level designs  
- Running simulations using **Icarus Verilog** and visualizing signals in **GTKWave**  
- Performing **logic synthesis** with **Yosys** and the **SKY130 Open-Source PDK**  
- Understanding core RTL design principles such as **testbenches**, **timing libraries**, **flip-flop implementations**, and **design optimizations**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements
Before you begin, make sure you have:
- **Basic knowledge** of digital circuits (logic gates, sequential circuits, FSMs, etc.)  
- Familiarity with **Linux/Unix command-line operations**  
- Access to a Linux environment (Ubuntu recommended, or WSL on Windows/macOS)  
- Installed tools:  
  - `git`  
  - `iverilog`  
  - `gtkwave`  
  - `yosys`  
  - Any text editor (VS Code, Vim, Nano, etc.)

## üìÇ Workshop Flow
The workshop is divided into **daily modules**, each with its own folder, code samples, and README guide:

- **Day 1** ‚Üí Getting Started with Verilog & RTL Basics  
- **Day 2** ‚Üí Timing Libraries, Synthesis Strategies, and Flip-Flop Coding Styles  
- **Day 3** ‚Üí Sequential & Combinational Optimization Techniques  
- **Day 4** ‚Üí Gate-Level Simulation (GLS) and Simulation vs. Synthesis Mismatches  
- **Day 5** ‚Üí Advanced Synthesis Optimizations  

Each module provides:
- Concept explanations in simple language  
- **Step-by-step lab exercises** with Verilog examples  
- Simulation and synthesis demonstrations with screenshots  
- Design tips and good practices for RTL coding
